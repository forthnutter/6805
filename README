6805 Emulator

This project started with need and want.

The need was a 6895 Emulator for a Computronics LTD. Sports controller.

It uses:
1. Motorla/Freescale MC68HC705C9A
2. A 20 Charcter 2 Line LCD
3. A keypad
4. RS485 Output
5. 7 Extra Opto Isolated Inputs
6. 2 Outputs
7. 1 Special High Voltage Input


The want was to learn to write programs in Factor. http://factorcode.org


To start with I am using some ideas from the 8080 emulator in the exsiting factor library
